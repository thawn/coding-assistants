Abstract

In today’s fast‑paced software development landscape, AI‑powered coding assistants have moved from experimental curiosities to indispensable productivity tools. This hands‑on session, “Practical Sessions: Coding Assistants and How to Set Them Up – Level Up Your Skills,” equips participants with the knowledge and practical experience needed to integrate, customise, and optimise these assistants within their own development workflows.

We begin with a brief overview of the most widely‑used coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, and the open‑source alternative continue.dev), highlighting their underlying models, licensing models, and typical use‑cases. Attendees then move to a step‑by‑step walkthrough of the end‑to‑end setup process:

    Environment preparation – configuring IDE extensions, API keys, and security policies.
    Model selection & alignment – choosing pre‑trained models, and applying prompt‑engineering to align the assistant with project‑specific conventions.
    Caveats –What works and what doesn't? Security and privacy issues. Which part of the code is better written by a human?

Throughout the workshop participants will work on a live coding challenge, experimenting with real‑time suggestions, refactoring assistance, and automated test generation. By the end of the session, attendees will be able to:

    Deploy a coding assistant in their preferred development environment with minimal friction.
    Tailor prompts and model parameters to maximise relevance and reduce noise.
    Establish best‑practice guardrails that ensure generated code meets quality, and security standards.

The session is designed for researcher and research software engineers, who are interested in (starting to) coding with the help of coding assistants. Basic familiarity with modern IDEs is helpful but not required. No prior experience with large‑language models is required—just a willingness to experiment and iterate. Join us to transform the way you write code and take your productivity to the next level.
